			<p>Imagine if we run a grocery store.</p>
			<p>And we want to find out what items are frequently bought together?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="2">
			<p>And we have the data of what different baskets have been bought by customers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="3">
			<p>A market basket analysis, or associated rule mining, looks at all these baskets, and identifies the items
				that are frequently bought together.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="4">
			<p>The higher <span class="step-highlight">the lift</span>, the more likely these goods are to be bought
				together.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="5">
			<p>The basket with a <span class="step-highlight">lift of 3</span>, is a basket that is <span
					style="font-weight:bold;">3 times</span> more likely to be bought together than normal.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="6">
			<p>We can also ask the question "what often gets bought with <span style="font-weight:bold;">洧논</span>?".
				Where <span style="font-weight:bold;">洧논</span> is a single item, e.g <span
					class="step-highlight">wine</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="7">
			<p>We can then see the basket of goods associated with <span class="step-highlight">wine</span> or <span
					style="font-weight:bold;">洧논</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="8">
			<p>Here's the cool part. <span class="step-highlight">洧논</span> can be anything. In our example it doesn't
				have to be a food item.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="9">
			<p>It can be a feature of your customers. E.g. <span class="step-highlight">repeat customers</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="10">
			<p>Or customers who <span class="step-highlight">spend above 춲50</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="11">
			<p>Or customers <span class="step-highlight">who never come again</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step="12">
			<p>For this case study, we're going to investigate the features of customers <span
					class="step-highlight">who churn</span>. Those who cancel their subscription to the scientific
				publishing platform.</p>
