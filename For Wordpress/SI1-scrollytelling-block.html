					<p>During a Senior Data Analyst job interview I was asked to carry out a take home data analysis task
						and present my findings...
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>The task: identify accounts that were at risk of cancelling their subscription. Or in other words
						<strong>churn analysis</strong>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>I used predictive analytics to solve this. I carried out a bit of machine learning called <span class="step-highlight">associated
						rules mining</span>. Or <span class="step-highlight">market basket analysis</span>.</p> 
					<p>This was my first commercial opportunity to carry out predictive 
						analytics.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p>There were some challenges along the way. Encoding challenges. I had to first turn continuous data
						into categorical data...
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="5">
					<p>...before I could <span class="step-highlight">one hot encode</span> the data. Associated rules mining only works on binary data.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="6">
					<p>Once the data was ready, I hit another challenge. Tweaking the number of columns and the analysis parameters so it wasn't
						computationally expensive.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="7">
					<p>...And once I had my results, I had to create a data story to present my findings. To provide business recommendations.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="8">
					<p>Read on to find out how <span class="step-highlight">associated rules mining</span> or <span class="step-highlight">market basket analysis</span>
					works.</p> 
					<p>Why it's a good choice for churn analysis. How I overcame the challenges of encoding and computation time...</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="9">
					<p>...and how it led to a job offer. Which I turned down.</p>
